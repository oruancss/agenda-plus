# Agenda-plus
ðŸ“• This project is actually a kind of a CRUD, but made as an agenda.

### Instalation

- First off get your webserver (I'd recommend XAMPP or something similar).
- After you get your webserver, you have to install the database, you'll find the SQL file inside the folder "install-db", just import to your phpMyAdmin.
- Config your database acess (user, pass and database name) inside coredb.php, you might find it inside the folder called "system".

### How can I create my user?

Inside the SQL file you've imported to your phpMyAdmin, has a default user. User and pass is "admin", but inside the panel you can create more users and passes!

**That's all, I hope you enjoy this project.**
